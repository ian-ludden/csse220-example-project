# Milestone 0 (M0) README
This file contains instructions for completing Milestone 0. See the [M0 Report template](./M0_Report.md). 

## 1. Write System Description
Describe the requirements of your system/application in words, as we have seen for design problems throughout the course. Include enough detail to guide your design process, but do not go into implementation details (e.g., "using a KeyListener") or minor features (e.g., "orange 'Save' button"). You will likely find 2-3 paragraphs sufficient. 

Once your entire team has reviewed and approved the system description, add it to your M0 Report. 

## 2. Draft Milestones
Plan out which parts of your application to build for each of the four remaining milestones. Estimating the amount of time it will take to add certain features is a notoriously difficult task in software development, which is why we are practicing now. 

Consider using the following genAI prompt structure to get a rough draft which you can then review and modify as a team: 
```
I am a (INSERT YEAR)-year undergraduate student majoring in (INSERT MAJOR). I am part of a team of (INSERT NUMBER) students working on a four-week final project in an object-oriented software development course. We need to design and build a mid-size Java GUI-based (Swing) application from scratch. Our application needs to include the following feature types: 
(INSERT HERE, FROM PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS).

Our proposed system description is: 
(INSERT HERE).

Propose a milestone structure for the four-week project to help us gradually build our application. For each milestone, include a description of the deliverables, emphasizing an iterative design process and team reflection/metacognition. 
 
Highlight a small number of potential obstacles we may encounter during this project, and suggest ways we might proactively prepare for these obstacles.
```

If you do use genAI to help you get started, be sure to review the proposed milestones as a team and adjust them to suit your goals and pace the workload. 

Update Section 2 of your M0 Report with your planned milestones. 

## 3. List Potential Classes
Based on your system description, draft a list of possible class names your design might need. Add these to Section 3 of your M0 Report. Consider categorizing your list of possible classes based on the milestone in which you expect to first create them. 

## 4. Create UML Class Diagram for M1
Using [PlantUML](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml), create a UML class diagram of the classes you plan to create for Milestone 1. You may find it helpful to expand this UML to include classes from the other milestones, but you only need to submit your M1 UML as part of your M0 Report.
